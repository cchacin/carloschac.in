After a long day trying to figure out how to reset all my IntelliJ settings, I decided to write this to document the obvious solution that was not that obvious to me.

I was using the 🔥 JetBrains Toolbox App 🔥 for a while to manage my IntelliJ Idea Ultimate installation along with other tools like Rider, WebStorm, and the Early Access Preview for IntelliJ Community Edition.

After several installations and reinstallations of IDEs and different Java/JDK versions (8, 9, 11, 14), the IDE was not able to import my maven projects. The IntelliJ IDEA was acting as a simple text editor at this time 😟.

## 💀 Failed attempt to solve it 🔇

1. Uninstall IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate using the Toolbox App
2. Uninstall the Toolbox App
3. Delete the following directories:

```bash
$ rm -rf ~/Library/Application\ Support/JetBrains/
```

```bash
$ rm -rf ~/Library/Caches/JetBrains/IntelliJIdea2020.1
```

4. Reinstall IntelliJ IDEA without using Toolbox

```bash
$ brew cask install intellij
```

## 💊 The obvious and simple solution 🍏
